\section basic Basic build

Tracter has a lot of optional dependencies, but only one mandatory
one: Kiss FFT.  First unpack tracter; then to prepare Kiss FFT, just
get it from the <a href="http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/">Kiss
web-site</a> and unpack it somewhere.

Once both are unpacked, the following should do a basic build:
\verbatim
cd build
export KISSFFT_DIR=/path/to/kiss_fft_v1_2_8
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local ..
make install
\endverbatim
Of course, change the install prefix to wherever you like.

The install will install a pkgconfig file. To allow other programs to
find the pkgconfig, add the path to the environment variable:
\verbatim
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig  # sh
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH $HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig  # csh
\endverbatim

\section involved More involved build

For a more involved build, see the example configure script:
\verbatim
cd build
cp Configure.sh.example Configure.sh
\endverbatim
edit the configure script to reflect your environment.
Then
\verbatim
./Configure.sh
make install
\endverbatim
will install the software locally.

The different packages that tracter will link against each have
different means of pointing at them.  The ones that use pkgconfig will
tend to be linked in automatically.  Others require an environment
variable or an entry on the search path.  See the configuration
example.
