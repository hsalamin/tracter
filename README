As of March 2010, the build system is based on CMake.  To build, you
should only need to do the following:

 cd build
 cp Configure.sh.example Configure.sh
 (edit Configure.sh to suit your environment)
 ./Configure.sh
 make
 make install

You must specifiy a path to kissfft; other dependencies are optional.
The executables will appear in build/src

Documentation is provided in doxygen form.  Go to the build directory
(the directory containing Doxyfile) and type

 doxygen

You can then point a browser at html/index.html
