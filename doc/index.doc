\section intro Introduction

Tracter is a data flow framework.  It was written initially for doing
speech signal processing in the context of the <a
href="juicer.html">Juicer ASR engine</a>.  It has developed into more
of a wrapper for other packages.  For instance, it can generate HTK
features by linking with HTK's library.  Written and maintained at
Idiap, tracter contains contributions from other AMIDA partners,
notably the universities of Sheffield and Brno.

\section download Obtaining the source code

Tracter is available <strong>here</strong>.  It is released under a
BSD license, which is quite permissive.  Further information is in the
README in the distribution.

Tracter has quite a lot of optional external library dependencies.
 - <a href="http://kissfft.sourceforge.net/">Kiss FFT</a> is a
simple BSD licensed FFT library.
 - <a
href="http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/Free_Resampling_Software.html">libresample</a>
is used for sample rate conversion.
 - If present, <a href="http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/">HTK</a> can be
linked in to enable true HTK feature generation.  Other features can
be written in HTK format without this dependency.
 - <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> is used for audio
acquisition under linux.  We planned to replace this with <a
href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/">RtAudio</a>.  Having
tried that out, it seems it doesn't use the plug interface, so <a
href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio</a> might be another way to
go.
 - BSAPI (the <a href="http://speech.fit.vutbr.cz/">Brno Speech</a>
API) can be used to generate features used in the NIST RT evalutions.
